 Engineering Zoomcamp – Progress & Portfolio

This repository documents my journey through the Data Engineering Zoomcamp. It reflects a focus on independent implementation, code refactoring, and mastering modern data pipelines.Data

Repository Structure

📂 2026_cohort/ (Active Development)

Current Status: In Progress 

This directory contains my active work for the 2026 live cohort.

Approach: I focus on adapting the course material rather than simply copying boilerplate code. This involves custom implementations and exploring alternative solutions to ensure a deep understanding of the concepts.

Tech Stack: Docker, Terraform, GCP, Airflow, DBT.

📂 archive_2025/ (Legacy)

Status: Discontinued

This folder contains initial work from the previous cohort curriculum.

Context: I began this module when the 2025 cohort was already archived. Midway through, I experienced a critical workstation failure.

Decision: Rather than resuming the outdated archived material on a new machine, I made the strategic decision to pause and restart with the 2026 Live Cohort. This ensures my skills align with the latest industry tools and curriculum updates.

This project is part of my continuous learning path in Data Engineering.
